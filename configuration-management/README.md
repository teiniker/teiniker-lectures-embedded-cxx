* [**Version Control**](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-computerscience/tree/master/configuration-management/versioning)

    - [Layout of C/C++ projects](building/project-layout/README.md)
    - [Steps of a C/C++ build process](building/build-steps/)
    - [C/C++ compiler flags](building/compiler-flags/)
    
* [**Test Automation**](testing/)

* [**Debugging**](debugging/README.md)
